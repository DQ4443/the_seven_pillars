This is a decisive and sophisticated shift. Moving from "The Lab" to "Elite Mentorship" (Crimson Education vibes) elevates the brand value significantly. It positions the service not just as "tutoring," but as Cognitive Reconstruction.

We are pivoting the aesthetic from "Blueprint/Schematic" to "Prestigious/Institutional." Think: Serif fonts, deep navy blues, warm gold accents, generous whitespace, and high-end photography.

Here is the Master Design Specification v8.0, detailed in the exact order you requested.

MASTER DESIGN SPECIFICATION v8.0: "The Ivy League Pathway"
Core Narrative: The shift from "External Pressure" (Passive) to "Internal Drive" (Active).

Visual Theme: "Modern Academic Excellence."

Aesthetic:

Primary: Oxford Blue (#002147), Pure White (#FFFFFF).

Accent: Satin Gold (#C5B358) for success states/CTAs.

Typography: Merriweather (Serif) for Headlines (Authority), Inter (Sans-Serif) for Body (Modernity).

1. COMPONENT: HERO (The Vision)
   Goal: Instant Authority. High-end academic positioning. Layout: Split Screen or Centered overlay on high-quality imagery.

Background: A high-res photo of Dr. Ricky teaching in a bright, clean, premium classroom. (Not a dark lab).

The Animation: Subtle, elegant motion. A "Gold Thread" (SVG line) weaves through the air near the whiteboard, symbolizing the connection of logic.

The Copy:

Slogan: "From 'Have to Learn' to 'Want to Learn'."

Sub-headline: "We don't just teach the curriculum. We rebuild the student's psychological approach to learning using the 5F Holistic Intelligence Cycle."

CTA: [Apply for Diagnostic Assessment] (Gold Button, Serif text).

2. COMPONENT: TESTIMONIALS (Social Proof)
   Goal: Immediate validation before introducing the problem. "Hear what our parents think." Visual: "The Wall of Excellence." A premium horizontal scroll (Carousel).

Design: White cards with a subtle shadow (elevation).

Content (From your inputs):

Card 1 (The Credential): "I saw a PhD from Tsinghua/Peking Union... teaching my middle school daughter. It felt surreal." — Parent.

Card 2 (The Engagement): "Dr. Ricky tells stories from his time as a scientist... Science is actually interesting!" — Student.

Card 3 (The Introvert): "My son never dared to speak up... Now he stays focused because he knows Dr. Ricky will call on him." — Parent.

Card 4 (The Private Chef): "He is like a 'Private Chef' for education. He knows exactly where my child struggles." — Parent.

3. COMPONENT: PAIN POINTS (The Diagnosis)
   Goal: Address the "Why". Use Attribution Theory & Locus of Control. Visual: "The Psychology of Failure vs. Success." Two contrasting columns.

Column Left (The Status Quo - Gray/Muted): "The External Trap" (External Locus of Control).

Icon: A broken chain.

Symptoms:

Behavior: "Addicted to AI for answers. Homework is a chore."

Mindset: "Success is luck. Failure is 'the teacher's fault'."

Result: The "Homework War" between parent and child.

Column Right (The Solution - Blue/Gold): "The Internal Engine" (Dr. Ricky's Way).

Icon: A lit torch.

Transformation:

Behavior: "Uses logic to derive answers. Seeks challenges."

Mindset: "Success is effort. Failure is data for improvement."

Result: Psychological Safety & Intrinsic Drive.

4. COMPONENT: THE SOLUTION (The 5F Loop)
   Goal: Visualizing the "Holistic Intelligence Cycle." Visual: "The Virtuous Cycle." NOT a linear flowchart. A circular, interactive "Flywheel."

Interaction: The user sees a circle divided into 5 segments. The wheel rotates slowly. Hovering over a segment expands it (Accordion style or Pop-over) to reveal the deep psychology.

Segment 1: FUN (Psychological Safety)

Concept: Low Anxiety / High Challenge.

Detail: "We replace judgment with curiosity. When the brain feels safe, it opens. We don't criticize effort; we only reward progress."

Segment 2: FOCUS (Flow State)

Concept: The CCTV Method (Challenge-Connection-Transformation-View).

Detail: "No passive listening. We use 'Cognitive Conflict' to trigger a Flow State. The student becomes the center of the derivation."

Segment 3: FINISH (Executive Function)

Concept: Project-Based Learning.

Detail: "Homework isn't a task; it's a memory encoding project. We train the brain to Plan, Initiate, and Monitor (Executive Function)."

Segment 4: FEEDBACK (Formative Assessment)

Concept: Diagnosis vs. Answer.

Detail: "AI gives answers. We give diagnosis. We identify the specific 'logic gap' that caused the error."

Segment 5: FIX (Growth Mindset)

Concept: Metacognition.

Detail: "Thinking about thinking. Transforming 'I'm bad at this' into 'I need to debug this step.' Errors become upgrades."

5. COMPONENT: VIDEO
   Goal: Placeholder for dynamic content. Visual: A large, rounded-corner video container with a "Play" button overlay. Caption: "See the 5F Cycle in Action inside the Classroom."

6. COMPONENT: DETAILED EVIDENCE (Results)

Design: A grid of 3 distinct stories.

Story A: "The Turnaround" (Student went from failing to A+).

Story B: "The VCE Crusher" (High ATAR result details).

Story C: "The Early Starter" (Year 9 student mastering Year 11 Chem).

7. COMPONENT: STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS (The Cohort)

Chart 1: School Composition.

Data: "40% Private School", "40% Selective Entry", "20% High-Performing Public".

Chart 2: Ambitions.

Data: "Medicine/Dentistry", "Law", "Engineering", "Science Research".

Copy: "Your child will learn alongside motivated peers who normalize excellence."

8. COMPONENT: TIMETABLE (The Schedule)
   Goal: Clarity and Strategy. Visual: A Clean, Tabbed Calendar Interface.

Tabs: Year 9 | Year 10 | VCE Unit 1/2 | VCE Unit 3/4.

The Grid:

Rows: Weekday / Weekend.
